Why It's the GOAT: Features that Slay
The AI Brain üß†

This isn't your average tracker. It uses the power of Artificial Intelligence to give you insights you never knew you needed.

üîÆ Future Predictions: Our AI looks at your past performance and uses a custom-built machine learning model to predict your completion rate for next week. Will you be a habit champion or a slacker? The AI knows.

ü§ù Habit Matchmaker: It analyzes your habits to find hidden connections. The app can tell you, "Our AI suggests that on days you successfully complete your Food Habits, you also tend to succeed with Physical Activities. Try doing these together!"

Who said productivity couldn't be beautiful?

Clean and Sleek: The design is so clean, it makes you want to get your life in order. With a beautiful, mobile-first design, it looks great on any device.
